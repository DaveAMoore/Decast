# Proposal

## Overview


## Software Components
There are three distinct components that will comprise the software for this project. Each individual unit will serve a particular function, and have varying degrees of complexity.

### On-Device API
The hardware module designed and developed by the the team will have an API that enables interaction between it and the *Cloud API*. There are multiple components of this subsystem that should be illustrated. Security is critical for this system, and it will begin with a secure authentication establishment process between the device and the server-side API. Besides security, the device API will allow for specific infrared (IR) codes to be transmitted, which will be communicated by the server.
